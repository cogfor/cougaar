	* PersistenceServiceComponent.java:
	Bug #3438 -- Persist exception fails to clearMarks()
	Replace clearMarks with addExistingMarkedAssociations. This
	assumes that any marked associations correspond to earlier persist
	failures. The marked associations are persisted again.

2004-01-05  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* PersistenceServiceComponent.java:
	Bug #3438 -- Persist exception fails to clearMarks()
	Moved clearMarks call to finally clause of try block.
	Undo the above. The marks should remain. This requires a little
	more thought and probably the checkMarks should be removed.

2003-09-04  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* PersistenceServiceComponent.java: 
	Bug #3296 -- No quiescence after agent moves
	Removed unused code still referencing BasePersistence.

	* PersistenceAssociation.java: 
	* FilePersistenceBase.java: 
	* BasePersistence.java: 
	Bug #3296 -- No quiescence after agent moves
	Removed BasePersistence to avoid replicating changes to
	BlackboardPersistence in this obsolete class. Used the
	utilities in PersistenceServiceComponent instead of
	BasePersistence.

	* BlackboardPersistence.java: 
	Bug #3296 -- No quiescence after agent moves
	Include quiescenceMonitorState in persisted data.

2003-08-27  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* IdentityTable.java:
	But #3277 -- Persist takes too long
	The count of items in the IdentityTable was never being
	incremented (or decremented) giving the misleading appearance that
	the hash table was empty and did not need to be expanded. As more
	objects were persisted, the search time to find matches increased
	quadratically with the number of objects. Increment and decrement
	the count when adding and removing entries in the table.

2003-04-24  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* PersistenceServiceComponent.java: 
	Bug #2838 -- Persistence lacks per-agent configurability
	Separate node-wide and per-agent variables so the former specify
	default configuration and the later specify per-agent configure.
	Add per-agent defaults for per-media parameters. Move all
	per-media parameterization to the media plugins.
	Revise setParameter to expect multiple parameters the first of
	which is the agent id and the remainder are per-agent
	configuration parameters. In addition, add a system property to
	specify these parameters to work-around a shortcoming of agent
	parameterization in CSMART and ACME.

	* Exercise.java: 
	Bug #2838 -- Persistence lacks per-agent configurability
	Revise to test these changes.

	* PersistenceServiceForBlackboard.java:
	Bug #2838 -- Persistence lacks per-agent configurability
	Remove disableWrite method. This function is now controlled
	directly with parameters of the PersistenceServiceComponent.

	* PersistenceNames.java: 
	Bug #2838 -- Persistence lacks per-agent configurability
	Move all parameter names to this interface to facilitate
	uniformity of names for properties, parameters, and parsing
	constants.

	* PersistencePluginAdapter.java: 
	* PersistencePlugin.java: 
	Bug #2838 -- Persistence lacks per-agent configurability
	Move all per-plugin parameter handling from
	PersistenceServiceComponent to the plugin itself. Part of
	making parameter handling uniform. Also make the writability of
	persistence a per-media parameter rather than node-wide. This
	makes it possible to rehydrate from one medium, but not use that
	medium for subsequent persistence.

	* FilePersistenceBase.java: 
	* DummyPersistence.java: 
	* DatabasePersistence.java: 
	Bug #2838 -- Persistence lacks per-agent configurability
	Regularize parameter handling to facility multiple sources of
	parameterization. Parameter names moved to a separate interface to
	insure uniformity.

	* PersistenceServiceComponent.java: 
	* BasePersistence.java:
	Bug #2743 -- Dots and other characters printed to System.err/out

2003-03-13  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* TestFullSnapshot.java:
	Test plugin creates full snapshots after publishAdding a lot of
	objects and then again after publishRemoving those objects. Used
	to test that the removed objects are not included in the the full
	persistence snapshot.

	* Persistable.java:
	Interface for potentially persistable objects. The isPersistable()
	method from the Publishable interface has been moved here and
	Publishable now extends this interface. It was illogical that the
	Publishable interface declared the isPersistable method.

	mirrored persistence services to plugins and other blackboard
	clients.

	* PersistenceServiceForAgent.java: 
	Bug #1848 -- Need persistence of component hierarchy for mobile agents
	Agent-specific interface to persistence. Used to initiate rehydration.

	* PersistenceMetricsServlet.java:
	Bug #1655 -- Add metrics for persistence size & frequency
	A servlet for viewing the persistence metrics of an agent. Shows a
	table of the retained persistence snapshots with sorting and
	average metrics for full, delta, and all snapshots.

	* PersistenceMetricsServiceImpl.java: 
	Bug #1655 -- Add metrics for persistence size & frequency

	Remove registration of PersistenceControlService.

	* Persistence.java: 
	Bug #1655 -- Add metrics for persistence size & frequency
	Extend to define methods for registering and unregistering
	services supplied by Persistence.

	* PersistencePlugin.java: 
	Bug #1655 -- Add metrics for persistence size & frequency
	Persistence metrics include full identification of the plugin
	performing the snapshot. Extend this interface to define methods
	for retrieving parameters.

	* PersistencePluginAdapter.java: 
	Bug #1655 -- Add metrics for persistence size & frequency
	Persistence metrics include full identification of the plugin
	performing the snapshot so plugins need to retain this. This
	adapter base class retains and supplies the information when
	needed for creating a PersistenceMetricsService.Metric.

	* FilePersistenceBase.java: 
	* DummyPersistence.java: 
	* DatabasePersistence.java: 
	Bug #1655 -- Add metrics for persistence size & frequency
	Persistence metrics include full identification of the plugin
	performing the snapshot so plugins need to retain this. It was
	previously forgotten once initialization was completed.

	* BasePersistence.java: 
	Bug #1655 -- Add metrics for persistence size & frequency
	Instantiate PersistenceMetricsServiceImpl. (Un)register services
	when requested. Make existing statistics gathering unconditional
	(instead of only for info logging) and gather additional info.
	Create PersistenceMetricsService.Metric items after persisting and
	add to the PersistenceMetricsServiceImpl.

	* Exercise.java:
	A simple plugin that gives persistence work to do by publishing
	items that consume time and space when being serialized. For now,
	rewrite the code to change the time/space/frequency of operation.

2003-01-23  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* PersistencePluginAdapter.java:
	Bug #2346 -- 2 Agents writing to the same robustness directory
	Add stub implementations of new API.

	* PersistencePlugin.java:
	Bug #2346 -- 2 Agents writing to the same robustness directory
	Add ownership methods. Add deleteOldPersistence argument.

	* PersistenceException.java:
	Add constructor accepting a message and an (caused by) exception.

	* FilePersistenceBase.java:
	Bug #2346 -- 2 Agents writing to the same robustness directory
	Implement the new ownership methods of the API. Assume ownership
	during init (lock mutex, write owner file, unlock mutex) and
	implement lock/unlock methods where lock only succeeds if the
	instance is the current owner.

	* FileMutex.java:
	Bug #2346 -- 2 Agents writing to the same robustness directory
	This class implement a simple mutual exclusion capability based on
	the file rename operation being atomic. That is, it assumes that
	if a file is renamed, the operation will only be successful if a
	file with the new name did not previously exist and that only one
	such rename can be successful regardless of the machine on which
	it is executed.

	* DummyPersistence.java: 
	Bug #2346 -- 2 Agents writing to the same robustness directory
	Implement API changes.

	Clear persistence in init method.

	* BufferedFilePersistence.java:
	Bug #2346 -- 2 Agents writing to the same robustness directory
	Clear persistence in init method.

	* BasePersistence.java:
	Bug #2346 -- 2 Agents writing to the same robustness directory
	Use ownership control methods of persistence plugins to
	synchronize access to persistence data (mutual exclusion) so that
	multiple agent instances can coordinate activity and avoid actions
	by agent instances no longer owning the persistence data (dead
	agents).
	Also, move old persistence clearing activity to plugin
	initialization instead of rehydration. Persistence clearing
	messes up the ownership logic.

2003-01-17  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* BasePersistence.java:
	Add toString() method so Persistence instances print something
	meaningful when included in log messages.
	Bug #2400 -- Make information on persist failures available in log
	Add error level log message with the exception.

	* FilePersistenceBase.java:
	Bug #2304 -- Persistence tries to write file "newSequence" to the CWD
	Fixed by including the persistenceDirectory in constructing Files.

	* PersistenceOutputStream.java: 
	* PersistenceInputStream.java:
	Bug # 1640 -- Exception when trying to rehydrate
	References to PlanElements that have not been (or are no longer)
	published should not be persisted. The code to do this erroneously
	accounted for the omitted objecs (by counting them as existing).
	However, omitting the object from the persistence snapshot will
	result in null references after rehydration. In the case of the
	tasks of workflows and the aggregations of compositions, these
	null will usually lead to NPE. The presence of such objects is
	indicates a problem at the application level so the debug message
	has been rephrased as an ERROR message.

2002-06-26  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* BufferedFilePersistence.java:
	Enh #1547 -- Persists take long time, blocking agent progress
	Persistence plugin that soaks up persistence output into ram
	buffers and spools out the data to a (presumably slow) file
	system. This allows the writing of a persistence snapshot to
	complete more quickly and let the actual data writes proceed in
	the background.

	* BufferedFileSystem.java:
	Enh #1547 -- Persists take long time, blocking agent progress
	New file provides support for BufferedFilePersistence plugin.
	Opens buffered file output streams using a separate thread to
	spool the data to the file long after the stream has been written
	and closed. Uses up to 10 MBytes of buffering. Provides hooks for
	synchronizing renames and reads with the buffered output.

	* FilePersistence.java:
	* FilePersistenceBase.java:
	Enh #1547 -- Persists take long time, blocking agent progress
	Factored out the code common to all file-based persistence plugins
	into FilePersistenceBase.java leaving just abstract method
	implementations in FilePersistence.

	* BasePersistence.java:
	Enh #1547 -- Persists take long time, blocking agent progress
	Use StringUtility.parseCSV() to parse plugin parameters. This
	allows for quoting the separator character which is necessary for

	if it does not. The cost of calling mkdirs when it's not needed is
	miniscule.

	* BasePersistence.java:
	Bug #1536 -- NotPersistable object are persisted
	Revise copyAndRemoveNotPersistable to actually remove
	EnvelopeTuples for not persistable objects. Copies of Envelopes
	having such tuples are created without the not persistable

	objects out of pendingEnvelopes and transactionEnvelopes of
	PersistenceSubscriberState.
	
	* BasePersistence.java:
	Bug #1539 -- Publishable.isPersistable is ignored

	* BasePersistence.java:
	Add DataProtectionService. Implement DataProtectionServiceClient.
	Use DataProtection Service to wrap input and output streams.

2002-05-09  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* BasePersistence.java:
	Re-interpret "disabled persistence" as install only the dummy

2002-01-24  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* DatabasePersistence.java:
	Fix bug 1014
	The query to update the status of incremental deltas in the
	database was being overwritten with the query to update the status
	of full deltas so incremental deltas remained active forever and
	were never scavenged. Also the argument specifying if a delta were
	full or not was misspelled and so no delta was ever marked as
	"full". Consequently, all deltas were incremental and never
	scavenged.
	There was no provision to scavenge full deltas when archiving is
	disabled. This now fixed so the persistence database can be kept
	as trim as possible.

	* BasePersistence.java:
	Fix bug 1014
	Document clear property
	Add org.cougaar.core.cluster.persistence.archivingDisabled
	property to allow archiving to be disabled.
	Add org.cougaar.core.cluster.persistence.consolidationPeriod
	property to control how ofter full deltas are generated. Defaults

	* RehydrationResult.java:
	Used to pass back the MessageManager after rehydration in addition
	to the old return result. The MessageManager is not managed by the
	persistence module any more. See BasePersistence.

	* PersistenceOutputStream.java:
	Add accessor to get the bytes of the output stream. Used to
	provide the object needed to implement getState().

	* PersistenceObject.java:
	A wrapper around a byte array of serialized persistence
	information. Used to implement the component getState methods.

	* PersistenceNotEnabledException.java:
	An exception to throw when an operation requires persistence to
	be enabled and it isn't.	

	* Persistence.java:
	Change interface to pass additional information in and out when
	performing persistence. See BasePersistence for details.

	* BasePersistence.java:
	Move management of MessageManager out of this class. It is now
	only a special object needing persistence (if present at all). Add
	rehydration from a PersistenceObject object containing a byte
	array of serialized persistence info. Intended for use with
	dynamic agents to rehydrate an agent at a new location. Also, on
	the other side, return said PersistenceObject when creating a
	persistence delta, if requested.
