	* deletion/SimpleDeletionPolicy.java:
	A simple implementation of DeletionPolicy.

	* deletion/DeletionSchedulePolicy.java:

	runs. Allows the period and phase of the periodic scheduling plus
	the specification of ad hoc, arbitrary times.

	* deletion/DeletionPolicy.java:
	New interface defining the API of deletion policies.

	* deletion/DeletionPlugin.java:
	New plugin class to perform periodic deletion of Deletable objects
	on the blackboard.

	* deletion/Deletable.java:
	New interface defining the API for deletable blackboard objects.

	* ServiceUserPlugin.java: 
	* PluginAlarm.java:
	Factored Alarm implementation out of ServiceUserPlugin so can be
	used by DeletionPlugin.

	* freeze/Rules.java:
	Bug #2771 -- Freeze rules cannot force non-plugins to freeze
	A small class for holding freeze rules and applying them to a
	prospective ThreadService consumer to determine whether the
	consumer should be allowed to run or denied from running.

	* freeze/FreezeTargetPlugin.java:
	Bug #2771 -- Freeze rules cannot force non-plugins to freeze
	Generalize rule implementation to include both deny and allow
	rules and treat plugin parameters as a list of rules of the form:
	{allow,deny} <classname>
	An initial rule applied before any rules specified as plugin
	params allows all freeze plugins to run.
	A final rule applied after all rules specified as plugin params
	denies running all plugins (extensions of PluginBase class).

	* freeze/FreezeTargetPlugin.java:
	Synchronize checkStopped method to avoid
	ConcurrentModificationException

	* freeze/FreezeSourcePlugin.java:
	Set the unfrozen agents list to all agents when starting a freeze
	in case there are no agents. Otherwise, no response will be sent.

	* freeze/FreezeSocietyPlugin.java:
	Changes to support debugging Deletion. Added current execution
	time display and a field for specifying the execution rate.

2003-03-17  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* freeze/FreezeNodePlugin.java: 
	Bug #1848 -- Need persistence of component hierarchy for mobile agents
	Remove now redundant check for
	NodeControlService.getRootContainer() returning AgentContainer. It
	is now defined to do so.

2003-03-14  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* freeze/FreezeSocietyPlugin.java:
	Bug #2659 -- Freeze plugins do not freeze time
	Set time rate to 0.0 when everybody is frozen. Set it back to 1.0
	when thawed.

2003-03-12  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* PluginManager.java: 
	Bug #2658 -- Components incompatible with automatic service revocation feature
	Test for null service before trying to use it.

2002-08-26  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* util/AllocationResultHelper.java:
	Bug #2102 -- concurrent mod exception in Univ Allocator during rehydration
	This bug is more pervasive than just the Univ Allocator and could
	occur in any plugin that calls Task.getPreferences() without
	synchronizing the task first. The AllocationResultHelper is used
	by several plugins (including the UniversalAllocatorPlugin) and
	failed to synchronize the task.

2002-08-13  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* freeze/readme.txt:
	Bug #2019 -- society freeze capability
	Description of how freeze works and how to use.

	* freeze/FreezeTargetPlugin.java: 
	* freeze/FreezeSourcePlugin.java: 
	* freeze/FreezeSocietyPlugin.java: 
	* freeze/FreezeRelayTarget.java: 
	* freeze/FreezePlugin.java: 
	* freeze/FreezeNodePlugin.java:
	Bug #2019 -- society freeze capability
	Plugins to propagate "freeze" from a servlet at NCA down to all
	agents and response back up to the servlet. Uses new feature of
	ThreadControlService to set a predicate that selects which threads
	are allowed to run. The default predicate for freezing plugins is
	any component extending PluginAdapter or ComponentPlugin except
	for the three Freeze*Plugins. Parameters of FreezeTargetPlugin
	name additional plugin classes that are allowed to run while
	frozen. Note that most servlets are allowed to run since they are
	not plugins or don't use the plugin thread.

2002-07-26  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* util/AllocationResultHelper.java:
	Fix Bug #1887 -- UniversalAllocator failing Consumable tasks at DLAHQ
	Algorithm for computing success was incorrect.

2002-07-12  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* TestABA.java:
	Test plugin for dynamic ABAs.

2002-06-28  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* ServiceUserPlugin.java:
	Bug #1540 -- Message could be more explanatory on setValue exception
	Use LoggingServiceWithPrefix for logging to identify the agent in
	every log message.

2002-05-22  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* ServiceUserPlugin.java:
	Remove debug.

	* DefaultPluginBinder.java:
	Change getPlugin to getComponent in toString() to eliminate
	exceptions when the binder is not binding a plugin. For example,
	when it binds a servlet component.

	* SimplifiedPlugin.java: 
	* SimplifiedFatPlugin.java: 
	* SimplePlugin.java: 
	Bug 1232
	Use closeTransactionDontReset

	* PluginDelegate.java: 
	Bug 1232
	Define closeTransactionDontReset.
	Deprecate closeTransaction(boolean);

	* PluginAdapter.java: 
	Bug 1232
	Use closeTransactionDontReset

2002-04-19  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* ServiceUserPlugin.java:
	Fix javadoc @link items -- they cannot be folder across multiple
	lines.

2002-04-10  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* ServiceUserPlugin.java: Base class for plugins using services
	that provided by other plugins. Supports waiting until all
	services are available before running.

	* ComponentPlugin.java:
	Set thread name to plugin name when running the plugin.

2002-03-21  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* ComponentPlugin.java:
	Bug #1011 (CompenentPlugin invoked execute too often)
	Only call execute() if wasAwakened() or
	blackboard.haveCollectionsChanged(). This means that execute()
	will be called only if a client or internal signal happened or if
	an external signal was actually associated with a change to a
	subscription of the plugin. This is the same behavior implemented
	for SimplePlugin.

2001-11-02  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* Node.java (Repository):
	Fix insertion point for agents.

	* FileInitializerServiceProvider.java (Repository):
	Fix interpretation of insertion point.

	* DBInitializerServiceProvider.java (Repository):
	Fix interpretation of insertion point.
	Change DBProperties api.

	Use revised initializer interface for getting plugin descriptions.
	(Repository): 

2001-08-17  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* PluginAdapter.java:
	Implement suspend/resume to call the threadingModel
	suspend/resume. Unregister interest in the subscription watcher.

2001-08-16  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* util/PluginAdapter.java:
	Modify suspend() and resume() for the SingleThread model to wait
	for the thread to actually respond to the suspend or resume
	request.

2001-05-01  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* util/PluginHelper.java:
	Update allocation results only when the change reports include a
	PlanElementImpl.ReportedResultChangeReport instance. This should
	be the only case in which it is necessary to update the estimated
	result. A new method, checkChangeReports, checks a set of reports
	for an instance of a given class. Used by the above, but available
	for plugins to use, too.

2001-04-30  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* util/AllocationResultHelper.java: Reuse newResult list instead
	creating a new one for each change. This is a major memory hog and
	reduces performance considerably.

2001-04-06  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* util/PluginHelper.java:
	Applies Bug #196
	Use isEqual instead of == to compare allocation results. Reduces
	extraneous plugin activation.

	* util/AllocationResultHelper.java:
	Applies Bug #196
	Fix reconcialition of task preferences with phased results. The
	preferences are not necessarily in the same order as the
	allocation results.

2001-04-03  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* util/PluginHelper.java:
	Applies to Bug #196
	Use AllocationResultHelper for createEstimatedAllocationResult.
	That code is now in AllocationResultHelper.

	* util/AllocationResultHelper.java:
	Applies to Bug #196
	New class supporting phased allocation results needed for the
	correct handling of multi-day projections.

1999-07-13  Ray Tomlinson  <rtomlinson@bbn.com>

	* PluginAdapter
	Provide default implementation of
	SubscriptionClient.getSubscriptionClientName of the form:
	<classname>[<params>]. This simplifies adapting plugins to changes
	made for persistence.

1999-02-10  Michael Thome  <mthome@bbn.com>

	* EssentialPlugin 
	Make various method protected and/or final.  Update subscription
	methods to take/return Subscription instead of Collection.
