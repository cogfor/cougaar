 * How to Configure the DeletionPlugin.
 * 
 * The DeletionPlugin runs according to a prescribed schedule to find
 * Deletable objects on the blackboard and delete them if they are ready
 * to be deleted. These actions are controlled by a
 * DelectionSchedulePolicy and one or more DeletionPolicy objects on the
 * blackboard. The DeletionPlugin guarantees that there is always a
 * DefaultDeletionPolicy present by creating on at startup (or restart)
 * if there is not one already present.
 * 
 * DeletionSchedulePolicy
 * 
 * The deletion schedule is characterized primarily by a period (how
 * often) and a phase (at what time of day). The public interface of the
 * standard DeletionSchedulePolicy allows all aspects of the schedule to
 * be altered including adding specific times for deletion to occur. The
 * current DeletionPlugin implementation insures that exactly one
 * DeletionSchedulePolicy exists on the blackboard creating one if
 * necessary and deleting extraneous ones. If an existing policy is
 * found, it is left as is. Subclasses could choose to insure that the
 * periodic schedule parameters agree with the values specified as plugin
 * parameters.
 * 
 * DefaultDeletionPolicy
 * 
 * The DeletionPlugin also guarantees that there is exactly one default
 * DeletionPolicy on the blackboard. If there are none, one is created
 * using plugin parameters. If there are multiples (should never happen),
 * extras are deleted.
 * 
 * DeletionPlugin Parameters
 * 
 * The DeletionPlug accepts four named parameters as follows:
 * deletionDelay=<long default 15 days>
 * deletionPeriod=<long default 7 days>
 * deletionPhase=<long 0 (midnight)>
 * archivingEnabled=<boolean>
 * 
 * The archivingEnable parameter causes a persistence snapshot to be
 * taken for archiving purposes prior to doing deletions.
