	* AllocationImpl.java:
	Bug #3260 -- Method getAllocationTask missing from AllocationforCollections
	Replace property descriptor for getAllocationTask with
	getAllocationTaskUID. It is impossible to provide full
	compatibility with former behavior.

2003-06-27  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* PlanElementImpl.java: 
	* NewPlanElement.java:
	Predictor reconciliation
	Add "resetTask" method to change the task of a PlanElement.
	Functionally like setTask, but allows for the planelement already
	being attached to a task. It rewires the task and the plan element
	accordingly.

2003-05-12  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* ContextOfOplanIds.java:
	Make equals work correctly. This now just extends HashSet, which
	provides the correct functionality with no effort.

2003-04-25  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* WorkflowImpl.java:
	Synchronize around writing of changedSubtasks. This only happens
	during persistence when there are no other plugins running, so it
	is probably not necessary, but it is logically correct.

2003-04-16  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* WorkflowImpl.java: 
	Bug #2598 -- ConcurrentModificationException in WorkflowImpl
	Make changedSubtasks transient.

2003-04-07  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* PlanElementImpl.java:
	Better message when publishAdd miswired PlanElement.

	* ClusterObjectFactoryImpl.java: 
	* ClusterObjectFactory.java: 
	* AllocationImpl.java:
	Changes to support revised AllocationforCollections API

	* AllocationforCollections.java:
	Change AllocationforCollections API to remember remote task UID
	and deleted flag instead of the whole task.

	* AspectScorePoint.java: 
	Bug #2722 -- ScoringFunction implementations have missing/incorrect equals methods
	AspectScorePoint also had no equals method. Sigh...

	* ScoringFunction.java:
	Bug #2722 -- ScoringFunction implementations have missing/incorrect equals methods
	Added equals methods to PiecewiseLinearScoringFunction,
	ConstantScoringFunction, StrictBetweenWithBest,
	EnumeratedScoringFunction implementations.

	* TaskImpl.java:
	Bug #2718 -- Subscriptions show unchanged tasks as "changed" after restart
	Don't transmit Workflows to other agents. Aside from being
	impossible, the rest of the fix for this bug won't work if the
	SpecialWorkflow marker is transmitted. Workflows are serialized
	only for persistence.

	* DeletionImpl.java: 
	* Deletion.java:
	Bug #1096 -- Received tasks are deleted without deleting the remote Allocation
	Factor the Deletion and Notification interfaces/classes into a
	base interface/class (TaskResponse) and sub-interfaces/sub-classes.

	* ClusterObjectFactoryImpl.java: 
	* ClusterObjectFactory.java: 
	Bug #1096 -- Received tasks are deleted without deleting the remote Allocation
	Use Task.isDeleted when constructing TaskRescind directives, which
	now have a deleted field, too. Also add another method for
	constructing TaskRescind with an additional boolean giving the
	deleted status of the directive.

2003-03-12  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* ScheduleImpl.java:
	Bug #xxxx -- Log files intermix EOL conventions.
	Use the platform line.separator to separate output lines to avoid
	mixing conventions within the log files.

	* WorkflowImpl.java:
	Bug #1954 -- Replace IllegalArgument exception with WARN message.
	This is happening all the time.

2003-02-12  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* WorkflowImpl.java: 
	Bug #1954 -- RescindLP removes expansion subtasks still in workflow
	Throw illegal argument exception if attempt to remove a subtask
	that is not part of the workflow. This is the only way I see for
	this bug to happen.
	
	* WorkflowImpl.java: 
	Bug #1296 -- Removing subtasks from a workflow
	The Workflow now manages the subtask result information. When a
	new aggregated AllocationResult is computed, an associated set of
	UIDs of subtasks contributing to the new result is updated. This
	allows a plug to ask for a list of subtasks whose changed results
	have caused the expansion result to change.
	Also cleaned up a really messy synchronization pattern. Half the
	code was synchronized on the workflow and the other half on the
	subtask vector. Since the subtasks are the essence of the
	workflow, it seems pointless to make the distinction. With these
	changes, workflows should now maintain internal consistency
	whereas before this was somewhat haphazard. The only known
	loophole is the getTasks method that returns an Enumeration of the
	subtasks Vector and cannot be protected from subsequent changes to
	that Vector by, for example, a rescind. The javadoc warns of this
	and suggests synchronization on the workflow while enumerating the
	subtasks.

	* Workflow.java:
	Bug #1296 -- Removing subtasks from a workflow
	Make getSubtaskResults an official part of the Workflow interface
	instead of a kludge accessor in ExpansionImpl requiring a plugin
	to cast the Expansion to ExpansionImpl.

	* TaskScoreTable.java: 
	Bug #1296 -- Removing subtasks from a workflow
	Rationalize the interface so it can be updated directly instead of
	constructing a new copy having the same data.

	* SubtaskResults.java: 
	Bug #1296 -- Removing subtasks from a workflow
	New class holds and allocation result in addition to the list of
	subtask information objects. This allows the state of the workflow
	and subtasks to advance beyond the last aggregation of the subtask
	results without introducing a disagreement between the subtasks
	and the computed allocation result.

	* NewExpansion.java: 
	Bug #1296 -- Removing subtasks from a workflow
	Change return type of getSubtaskResults to an extension of List
	holding the allocation result aggregated from the subtasks held in
	the list.

	* ExpansionImpl.java:
	Bug #1296 -- Removing subtasks from a workflow
	Review of this code shows an accretion of various fixes and
	patches to a number problems that have been found over time. Bug
	#1296 reports a memory problem with expansions holding onto tasks
	after they have been removed from the workflow. Variables
	retaining this information have been removed from ExpansionImpl
	and the responsibility for creating subtask info moved into
	WorkFlowImpl.

2003-01-23  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* ScoringFunction.java:
	VScoringFunction is incorrect between BEST and point2
	Simplify and use inherent symmetry to compute score.

2002-08-30  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* AssetAssignmentImpl.java:
	Bug #2203 -- asset transfer errros
	Include the assignment kind (NEW, UPDATE, REPEAT) in toString to make
	logging useful.

2002-08-26  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* TaskImpl.java:
	Bug #2102 -- concurrent mod exception in Univ Allocator during rehydration
	Add a check in getPreferences for the caller having not
	synchronized the task. If not synchronized, log a debug message
	and return a BackedEnumeration instead of an ordinary Enumeration
	backed by the preferences collection. Copying the collection is
	expensive and should be avoided by synchronizing the task in the caller.

2002-08-22  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* AllocationResult.java:
	Bug 2104 -- Array index out of bound exception in AllocationResult
	after rehydration
	Add readObject and call clearMemos to properly initialize
	transient variables.

2002-08-20  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* AspectRate.java:
	Bug #2013 -- Universal Allocator sporadically failing at HNS
	AspectRate.equals had parameter type of AspectRate rather than
	Object so it did not match the signature of the equality
	comparison used by the StrictValueScoringFunction. Instead the
	base class (AspectValue) equals method was used comparing the type
	and (double) value. A second bug wherein the setValue method did
	not call super.setValue() caused the (double) value in AspectValue
	to not be update resulting in inequality.

2002-08-06  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* TaskImpl.java:
	Bug #1901 -- Deadlock (?) in persistence
	Allow for null prepositional phrase lists. Apparently there are some.

2002-08-05  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* TaskImpl.java:
	Bug #1901 -- Deadlock (?) in persistence
	Apparently Tasks can have prepositional phrases that refer
	(possibly indirectly) to other tasks having prepositional phrases
	referring back to the first task. When such tasks are serialized
	in multiple threads  (e.g. persistence and message transport), the
	tasks may be encountered in opposite order. Because serialization
	of an ArrayList synchronizes on the list, this constitutes a
	deadlock with each thread holding one lock while waiting for the
	other lock to be freed.
	Fix by copying the ArrayList into an array and serializing that
	instead. The ArrayList is reconstituted from the array during
	deserialization.

2002-07-23  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* TaskImpl.java: 
	Bug #1760 -- publishRemove of subtask still in a workflow should fail
	If debug is enabled, include a throwable in the log message to
	identify the caller.

2002-07-19  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* TaskImpl.java:
	Bug #1760 -- publishRemove of subtask still in a workflow should fail
	It should be illegal to remove a subtask from the logplan while it
	is still part of a workflow. Doing so leaves unpublished plan
	elements dangling from the workflow. Perhaps, removal from the
	workflow should be automatic. but that would be an API change.
	Instead throw a runtime exception to catch these cases so they can
	be fixed.

2002-07-10  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* ScoringFunction.java:
	Bug #1568 -- Universal Allocator result aspects don't match
	Supply aspect type when constructing AspectScorePoints. The
	ConstantScoringFunction constructor provided no way to specify the
	aspect type, so the constructors now have an additional aspect
	type argument. ScoringFunctions with multiple AspectValue or
	AspectScorePoint parameters do not check for homogeneity of aspect
	types across all such parameters. Only the first such parameter is
	used as the source for all constructed AspectValues and
	AspectScorePoints. This is _not_ a feature; it's for the sake of
	efficiency. Don't abuse it.

	* AspectScorePoint.java:
	Bug #1568 -- Universal Allocator result aspects don't match
	Change constructor to require aspectType instead of setting to 0.
	This is the source of the incorrect aspect types. All uses of the
	bad constructor I found were in ScoringFunction.java.

2002-02-25  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* ScoringFunction.java:
	Fix Bug 1101
	Add equals methods to all ScoringFunction implementations.

	* AssetVerificationImpl.java:
	Include the schedule in the toString value to aid in debugging.

	* AssignedRelationshipElementImpl.java:
	Add toString method to reveal detail of the element to aid in
	debugging.

2001-08-30  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* AllocationResult.java:
	Fix bug in constructor for merging two allocation results (e.g.
	received + observed). The old code left nulls in the rollup result
	array leading to NPE later.

2001-07-16  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* AggregationImpl.java
	Bug #410
	publishChange the task of an Aggregation that is removed as a side
	effect of propagating the removal of another Aggregation. This
	allows the task to be re-disposed.


2001-07-16  Jim Winston  <jwinston@bbn.com>
        * ScoringFunction.java:
	Bug #406
	Added public AspectValue getPoint() to SinglePointScoringFunction
	Added public AspectValue getPoint1() and 
	public AspectValue getPoint2() to TwoPointScoringFunction

2001-05-01  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* AllocationResult.java:
	Add nearlyEquals method to use AspectValues.nearlyEquals . See
	comments on the latter regarding problematic equality comparison
	of doubles.

	* AspectValue.java:
	Add nearlyEquals method using MoreMath.nearlyEquals to compare
	AspectValues. See comments on the latter regarding problematic
	equality comparison of doubles.

2001-04-30  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* AllocationResult.java:
	Bug #372
	Use AspectValue.compare(AspectValue[], AspectValue[]) to compare
	the aspect values of the result. Such arrays are really sets and
	should be compared in an order-independent way.

	* AspectValue.java:
	Bug #372
	Add method to compare two AspectValue[] that ignores differences
	in the order of the values. Used by AllocationResult.isEqual to
	correctly compute the equality of two AllocationResults.

2001-04-12  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* ExpansionImpl.java:
	Debugging support
	Change toString to show the UID of the plan element.

2001-04-06  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* AspectValue.java:
	Applies to Bug #196

	places in pending changes in glm to avoid aliasing bugs.

2001-04-04  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* AllocationResult.java:
	Applies to Bug #248
	Remove debugging code. This should cause the
	IllegalArgumentException caused by an incorrect AspectValue for
	the DEMANDRATE aspect to cease.

2001-04-03  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* TimeAspectValue.java:
	Applies Bug #196
	Fix toString() to assist in debugging phased allocation results.

	* ScheduleImpl.java:
	Applies to whatever the bug is about debugging output
	Remove debugging println. Lines saying "ListIterator" should
	cease.

	Applies to Bug #196
	Add missing clone method used when constructing new phase4d
	allocation results.

	* AspectRate.java:
	Applies to Bug #196
	Add missing clone method used when constructing new phased
	allocation results. Fix setValue method to actually set a new Rate
	value for an existing AspectValue. Needed to support changing
	phased allocation results.

	* AspectLocation.java:
	Applies to Bug #196
	Add missing clone method used when constructing new phased
	allocation results.

	* AllocationResult.java:
	Applies to Bug #196
	Correct bugs in handling of phased results. Redundant data
	structures removed since they were not correctly tracking each
	other and were of dubious benefit. Added toString() to assist
	debugging. Add clone().
