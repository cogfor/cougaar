	* SimpleTimeAdvanceComponent.java:
	Simple servlet to advance by a number of hours or days. Does not
	wait for completion or anything complex.

2003-06-12  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* CompletionSourcePlugin.java: 
	Bug #3033 -- Completion Event recieved yet servlet HTML view shows agents incomplete
	Give subclasses an opportunity to adjustLaggards before they are
	processed. The CompletionNodePlugin uses this to insure that
	agents that the NodeBusyService indicates are busy are also
	laggards.
	Also change getTargetNames() to be getTargets() returning the
	MessageAddress of the agents. This change was pending anyway and
	it greatly simplifies the use of the NodeBusyService, which
	accepts the MessageAddress of an agent.

	* CompletionSocietyPlugin.java: 
	Bug #3033 -- Completion Event recieved yet servlet HTML view shows agents incomplete
	Replace getTargetNames with getTargets().

	* CompletionNodePlugin.java:
	Bug #3033 -- Completion Event recieved yet servlet HTML view shows agents incomplete
	Adjust the Laggards that have reported in to account for those
	that have become busy (e.g. due to persistence). The Laggards for
	such agents are changed to indicate that they are not complete.
	Also add Laggards for any agents that are busy and missing from
	the list.

	* CompletionSourcePlugin.java:
	bug #2460 -- Timers sometimes fail to wake plugins with no subscriptions
	Added TIMER_SLACK variable/parameter to specify time to allow for

	Added equal sign.

	* CompletionNodePlugin.java:
	Replaced use of topology with NodeControlService list of
	agents on the local node.

	* CompletionSocietyPlugin.java: 
	Replaced use of topology with WhitePagesService utility to
	list all nodes.  This should be fixed to a scalable solution.

	* CompletionSourcePlugin.java:
        Removed use of TopologyReaderService

	* CompletionTargetPlugin.java:
	Bug #2083 -- Completion plugins should ignore tasks past the end of level 2 planning
	Code tweak to avoid NPE trying to create tasksPredicate. The
	predicate creation must be delayed until there is a ServiceBroker
	available. Use lazy evaluation.

	* CompletionEventInsertion-recipe.sql:
	Bug #2034 -- Add CougaarEvent generation to CompletionPlugin
	CSMART recipe for inserting completion plugins with parameters
	suitable for running under stress and generating completion
	events.

	Make time constants settable through plugin parameters to
	accomodate more leisurely updating of information required when
	under stress.
	Parameters are:
	SLEEP_INTERVAL=<long> time between completion checks
	ACTIVITY_DELAY=<long> time between checks for recent publish
	activity

	* CompletionSourcePlugin.java: 
	Bug #2034 -- Add CougaarEvent generation to CompletionPlugin
	Make time constants settable through plugin parameters to
	accomodate more leisurely updating of information required when
	under stress.
	UPDATE_INTERVAL=<long> sets interval between update cycles
	LONG_CHECK_TARGETS_INTERVAL=<long> sets interval between checks of
	topology to detect new nodes/agents after initialization.
	SHORT_CHECK_TARGETS_INTERVAL=<long> sets interval between checks of
	topology to detect new nodes/agents during initialization. Should
	be shorter to be more responsive to expected changes.

	* CompletionSocietyPlugin.java: 
	Bug #2034 -- Add CougaarEvent generation to CompletionPlugin
	Generate CougaarEvent when completion is achieved and lost.
	Make time constants settable through plugin parameters to
	accomodate more leisurely updating of information required when

	completion.

	* CompletionPlugin.java: 
	Bug #2034 -- Add CougaarEvent generation to CompletionPlugin
	Add missing publishChange after changing relay when persisting.
	Avoids waiting for next periodic update for propagating the
	change.

	* CompletionNodePlugin.java:

	* CompletionSourcePlugin.java: 
	* CompletionRelay.java:
	Bug #1786 -- Execution servlet doesn't
	Update for using RelayChangeReports was incomplete. The new target
	set was not being set so completion relays typically had no targets.

2002-07-19  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	Add final completion action to "persistNow" after advancement is
	complete.

2002-05-28  Ray Tomlinson  <RTomlinson@bbn.com>

	* CompletionTargetPlugin.java:
	Remove GLM-specific specialization (verbs to ignore) and provide
	interface whereby domain specializations can tailor the verbs to
	ignore.

	* CompletionSourcePlugin.java:
	Don't start waiting for completion until the relay targets have
	stabilized. This makes it easier for subclass CompletionActions to
	work reliably by not trying to invoke such actions until all
	agents and nodes are present and accounted for.

	* CompletionSocietyPlugin.java:
	Remove GLM-specific specializations and provide CompletionAction
	interface for extensions to specialize behavior such as publishing
	the oplan or sending GLS.

	* TestPlugin.java:
	A test plugin for debugging the completion determination. Provides
	a daily set of supply tasks derived from projections to give
	agents something to do as time passes.

	* LaggardFilter.java:
	Determines if a putative Laggard value is worth sending. Retains
	the last Laggard that was judged worthy of sending and judges if a
	new one should be sent depending on whether or not the change is
	significant or if sufficient time has passed.

	* Laggard.java:
	A brief summary of the state of laggardliness of an agent
	containing the cpuConsumption and taskCompletion values plus a
	boolean indicating if the agent is really a laggard or not.

	* CompletionTargetPlugin.java:
	A plugin for sensing agent activity and sending the completion
	status of the agent as responses to CompletionRelays. Both the
	presence and status of activity are sensed. If any Task or
	PlanElement is added, removed, or changed, the cpuConsumption
	countdown is restarted. cpuConsumption decreases linearly in time
	from 1.0 to 0.0 over a ten minute span. taskCompletion is computed
	as the average of the confidence ratings of the estimated
	allocation result of all tasks excluding certain tasks for which
	plugins fail to provide reliable confidence ratings
	(DetermineRequirements, getLogSupport and MaintainInventory).
	Updated values are sent as responses as warranted. Care is taken
	to limit the frequency of interesting, but insignificant changes.
	In particular, it really only matters if the laggard thresholds
	are crossed. Otherwise, the changes are not significant so updates
	are scheduled over long intervals.

	* CompletionSourcePlugin.java:
	Base class for plugins that send relays (CompletionNodePlugin and
	CompletionSocietyPlugin). Ascertains the correct set of targets,
	fashions a CompletionRelay and sends it. Retrieves the relay
	responses and dispatches them to subclass methods for handling.

	* CompletionSocietyPlugin.java:
	The root completion plugin. Gathers completion status from all
	nodes and decides when to advance execution time.

	* CompletionRelay.java:
	A Relay to request task completion and cpu activity status from
	nodes and agents.

	* CompletionPlugin.java:
	Base class provides some common services to subclasses

	* CompletionNodePlugin.java:
	A plugin for completion sensing in a NodeAgent. Identifies the
	Agents of the Node and sends them a CompletionRelay so they can
	report back the completion state. Subscribes to CompletionRelays
	from higher levels and reports a completion state based on those
	of the node's agents (least completed agent).
